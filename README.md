# CS302FinalProject
A collection of all the code for our game "Ensorcelled" by Cory Headrick and Louise Fry


HOW TO PLAY OUR GAME: 
Follow this link to a website hosting a web version of our game:
https://cheadri6.itch.io/ensorcelled
press run game, and then you can press the fullscreen button on the bottom right of the game window to see the whole game.



Controls:
Character Movement: arrow keys or WASD keys to move. 

You automatically interact with objects, no need to press a key to pick up a sword or fight the troll

Follow the UI on screen to click buttons or perform attacks inside the combat scene.


Purpose of the Game:
You are an adventurer who has answered the call to investigate a ruined mansion inside the swamp bordering the town. Make your way through the 
ruins by interacting with the objects around you and fighting your way through to the end. Use portals to jump between areas and pick up weapons in order to fight.

Known Bugs:
Player blurs when facing left. Teleporter resets the items you have already picked up in the dungeon. Navigation can be tricky without context. We inteneded to have text pop-ups and cutscenes in the game, but our third partner dropped without notifying us.

Other Notes:
We used Unity's collaborate tool for version/source control. This github repo is just for easy access for Ashley Babjac.
